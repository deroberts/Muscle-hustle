# Muscle Hustle Reviews

Our application for project 2 is a review app, where users can be able to post reviews about certain muscle cars they have owned before or currently own.

This application is particurly importnat to those who are seeking information as to what cars are a good investment, and those that car buyers should stay away from. 

# Technologies

Besides using Sequalize, MySQL, and Node.js, we have also been using Axios, bcrypt, and Cherrio.
